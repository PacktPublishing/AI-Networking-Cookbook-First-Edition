Transform your approach to network automation with the power of AI LLM assistants guided by hands-on recipes for building custom automation solutions quickly using artificial intelligence.
You’ll learn tools and techniques such as Vibe coding for conversational development, OpenAI API scripts, prompt engineering for better outputs, local LLM fine-tuning, combining models with LangChain, and Streamlit-based frontends development. The book progresses from simple Python scripts to advanced AI-assisted automation techniques, including multi-vendor API integration, showing you how AI can enhance network configuration, monitoring, security, and troubleshooting.
Each recipe presents realistic mock data, complete code examples, and step-by-step guidance, creating a safe environment for experimentation while building a solid foundation for future production use. Whether you want to automate routine configuration, implement AI-driven troubleshooting, or build compliance monitoring systems, this cookbook helps you connect your networking expertise with the capabilities of modern AI.</details>
