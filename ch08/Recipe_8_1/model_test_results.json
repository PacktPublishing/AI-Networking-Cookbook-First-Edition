Check the BGP configuration on both routers to ensure that the neighbor relationship is properly configured with the correct IP address and AS number.\n\n2. Verify that there is reachability between the two BGP neighbors by checking the routing table and running ping or traceroute commands.\n\n3. Check for any firewall or access control list (ACL) rules that may be blocking BGP traffic between the two neighbors.\n\n4.
